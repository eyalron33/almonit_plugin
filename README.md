ENS+IPFS Firefox plugin by Almonit

# installation
In Firefox, enter `about:debugging`.

Choose `Load Temporary Add-on...`

From the folder of the plugin, choose `manifest.json`

# usage
Navigate to ENS+IPFS websites such as:
- almonit.eth
- pepesza.eth
- portalnetwork.eth

# TODO
Quite a lot!

- plugin popup (after pressing plugin button in firefox bar)
- custom error page (referring to ENS+IPFS websites index/search)
- Decentralization via randomality: the plugin will choose each time a random IPFS gateway (that's a way of avoiding everyone using the same IPFS gateway, which is centrazliation)
- redesign ugly theme
- improve new ENS address bar
- remove classic address bar in ENS websites
